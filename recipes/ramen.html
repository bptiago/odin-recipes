        <h1>Chicken Ramen Bowl</h1>
        <img src="/home/bptiago/repos/odin-recipes/images/ramen.webp">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The holiday hoopla is over and I'm setting my sights on eating whole. Ramen has been all the rage and I've been dying to try this at home. 
            I never skimp on flavor even when I'm eating light. This dish is a total flavor bomb, filled with a rich broth, tender meat, and noodles, 
            topped with a 7-minute egg ; my new favorite thing in the world. My family went nuts for this; it's complex, easy, and satisfying. 
            You don't have to make the egg, but I think it's so worth it.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients List</h3>

            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 coocked chicken breast, shredded</li>
            <li>3/4 pound baby bok choy</li>
            <li>3 packages dried ramen noodles</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
                Add onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. 
                Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. 
                Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce; stir to combine. 
                Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes. 
                Add chicken and bok choy; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
                Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. 
                Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Drain and drizzle with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li>
                While ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. 
                Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer soft boiled eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; 
                let sit about 3 minutes. 
                Drain eggs, carefully peel away shells, and slice in half.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide ramen between 4 bowls. 
                Add broth. Top each with jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
