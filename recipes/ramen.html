        <h1>Chicken Ramen Bowl</h1>
        <img src="/home/bptiago/repos/odin-recipes/images/ramen.webp">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The holiday hoopla is over and I'm setting my sights on eating whole. Ramen has been all the rage and I've been dying to try this at home. 
            I never skimp on flavor even when I'm eating light. This dish is a total flavor bomb, filled with a rich broth, tender meat, and noodles, 
            topped with a 7-minute egg ; my new favorite thing in the world. My family went nuts for this; it's complex, easy, and satisfying. 
            You don't have to make the egg, but I think it's so worth it.
        </p>
